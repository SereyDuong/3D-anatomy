                            Your brain is an essential organ. All of your emotions, 
                            sensations, aspirations and everything that makes you
                            uniquely individual come from your brain. This complex organ
                            has many functions. It receives, processes and interprets
                            information. Your brain also stores memories and controls
                            your movements. Your brain is one component of your central
                            nervous system (CNS). It connects to your spinal cord, the
                            other part of your CNS.

                    <h3>What is the brain’s function?</h3>

                    <p>
                      Your brain receives information from your five senses:
                      sight, smell, sound, touch and taste. Your brain also
                      receives inputs including touch, vibration, pain and
                      temperature from the rest of your body as well as autonomic
                      (involuntary) inputs from your organs. It interprets this
                      information so you can understand and associate meaning with
                      what goes on around you.

                      <br />
                      Your brain enables:

                  <p>
                    Your brain’s structure is complex. <br />It has three main
                    sections:
                  </p>

                  <li>
                    Cerebrum: Your cerebrum interprets sights, sounds and touches. It also regulates emotions, reasoning and learning. Your cerebrum makes up about 80% of your brain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cerebellum: Your cerebellum maintains your balance, posture,
                    coordination and fine motor skills. It's located in the back
                    of your brain.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Brainstem: Your brainstem regulates many automatic body
                    functions. You don’t consciously control these functions,
                    like your heart rate, breathing, sleep and wake cycles, and
                    swallowing. Your brainstem is in the lower part of your
                    brain. It connects the rest of your brain to your spinal
                    cord.
                  </li>

                    <h3>What are the lobes that make up your brain?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Each side of your brain has different lobes (sections).
                      While all the lobes work together to ensure normal
                      functioning, each lobe plays an important role in some
                      specific brain and body functions:
                    </p>
                    <li>
                      Frontal lobes: The frontal lobes are in the front part of
                      your brain, right behind your forehead. This is the
                      largest lobe and it controls voluntary movement, speech
                      and intellect. The parts of your frontal lobes that
                      control movement are called the primary motor cortex or
                      precentral gyrus. The parts of your brain that play an
                      important role in memory, intelligence and personality
                      include your prefrontal cortex as well as many other
                      regions of your brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Occipital lobes: These lobes in the back of your brain
                      allow you to notice and interpret visual information. Your
                      occipital lobes control how you process shapes, colors and
                      movement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Parietal lobes: The parietal lobes are near the center of
                      your brain. They receive and interpret signals from other
                      parts of your brain. This part of your brain integrates
                      many sensory inputs so that you can understand your
                      environment and the state of your body. This part of your
                      brain helps give meaning to what's going on in your
                      environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Temporal lobes: These parts of the brain are near your
                      ears on each side of your brain. The temporal lobes are
                      important in being able to recall words or places that
                      you've been. It also helps you recognize people,
                      understand language and interpret other people’s emotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Limbic lobes: The limbic lobe sits deep in the middle
                      portions of your brain. The limbic lobe is a part of your
                      temporal, parietal and frontal lobes. Important parts of
                      your limbic system include your amygdala (best known for
                      regulating your “fight or flight” response) and your
                      hippocampus (where you store short-term memories).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Insular lobes: The insular lobes sit deep in the temporal,
                      parietal and frontal lobes. The insular lobe is involved
                      in the processing of many sensory inputs including sensory
                      and motor inputs, autonomic inputs, pain perception,
                      perceiving what is heard and overall body perception (the
                      perception of your environment).

                    <h3>
                      What is the difference between the left and right brain
                      hemispheres?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      Your cerebrum divides into two halves: the left and right
                      cerebral hemispheres. The two halves of the brain are
                      connected by nerve fiber bundles (white matter) called
                      your corpus callosum. The right side of your cerebrum
                      controls movement on the left side of your body and vice
                      versa.

                      <br />
                      Your left brain hemisphere is often the “dominant”
                      hemisphere — but this doesn’t apply to everyone. Most
                      people who are right-handed are usually left hemisphere
                      dominant. Some patients who are left-handed are right
                      hemisphere is dominant. Typically, the dominant hemisphere
                      is responsible for your speech and language functions.
                      Your non-dominant (which is the right hemisphere in most
                      individuals) is responsible for your spatial awareness and
                      processing of what you see.

                      <br />About 1 in 10 right-handed people and about 1 in 3
                      left-handed people have dominance in the right hemisphere.
                      This means that their speech functions are mostly centered
                      in the right side of their brains. Many times this is a
                      normal variant but in some people with brain tumors or
                      epilepsy, the dominance can be shifted through a process
                      called brain plasticity.

                    <p>
                      A bony structure called your cranium surrounds your brain.
                      Your cranium is part of your skull. All the bones of your
                      skull protect your brain from injury.

                      <br />
                      Between your brain and skull, you have three layers of
                      tissue called the meninges:
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      Dura mater: The outermost layer lines your entire skull.
                      Parts of the dura mater form folds that separate the right
                      half of your brain from the left.

                    <li>
                      Arachnoid: The middle layer of the meninges is a thin,
                      fragile layer of tissue that covers your entire brain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pia mater: The innermost layer contains blood vessels that
                      run into your brain’s surface.

                    <p>
                      Between your arachnoid and pia mater tissue is a clear
                      substance called your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF also
                      surrounds your spinal cord, which runs through the
                      vertebrae (bones of your spine). CSF cushions and protects
                      these vital nervous system organs.

                    <p>
                      Substances called gray and white matter make up your
                      central nervous system. In your brain, gray matter is the
                      outermost layer. It plays a significant part in your
                      day-to-day function. <br />White matter is your deeper
                      brain tissue. It contains nerve fibers that help your
                      brain send electric nerve signals more quickly and

                    <p>
                      Your brain contains several types of nerves. Nerves carry
                      messages by sending electrical impulses back and forth
                      between your brain, organs and muscles. The nerves in your
                      brain are called cranial nerves.You have 12 pairs of
                      cranial nerves from the brain to parts of your head and
                      face. These nerves are responsible for specific
                      sensations, such as hearing, taste or sight. White matter
                      is the fiber bundles that connect brain cells. There are
                      numerous white matter tracts that connect one area of your
                      brain to another, as well as structures deep in your
                      brain. These white matter tracts can also travel to your
                      brainstem and spinal cord so that information can be
                      relayed from your brain to communicate with the rest of
                      your body and information from your body can travel to
                      your brain.

                    <p>
                      Although most brain cells reside on the surface of your
                      brain (called gray matter) and the cabling (white matter)
                      is deep and connects various parts of your brain, there
                      are some nuclei (collection of brain cells) that reside
                      deep in your brain. They include:
                    </p>

                    <li>
                      Thalamus: Your thalamus is a structure residing deep in
                      your cerebrum and above your brainstem. This structure is
                      sometimes referred to as the switchboard of the central
                      nervous system. It relays various sensory information,
                      like sight, sound or touch, to your cerebral cortex from
                      the rest of your body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Hypothalamus: Your hypothalamus sits below your thalamus.
                      It's important in regulating various hormonal functions,
                      autonomic function, hunger, thirst and sleep. Your
                      hypothalamus and pituitary gland are important structures
                      involved in the control of your hormonal system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Pituitary gland: Your pituitary gland sends out hormones
                      to different organs in your body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Basal ganglia: Your basal ganglia are a group of nuclei
                      deep in your cerebrum that is important in the control of
                      your movement, including motor learning and planning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Brainstem nuclei: There are a number of nuclei situated in
                      your brainstem involved in a variety of different
                      functions including cells that give rise to a number of
                      important cranial nerves, normal sleep function, autonomic
                      functions (breathing and heart rate) and pain.

                    <li>
                      Reticular formation: Your reticular formation is a part of
                      your brainstem and thalamic nuclei. These are a part of
                      your reticular activating system (nuclei plus the white
                      matter connecting these nuclei), which lies in your
                      brainstem, hypothalamus and thalamus. The reticular
                      activating system (RAS) mediates your level of awareness,
                      consciousness and focus. They also help control your
                      sleep-wake transitions and autonomic function.

                    <p>
                      For many years, scientists thought the human brain had 100
                      billion nerve cells (neurons). Today, we know the actual
                      number is closer to 86 billion.

                      <br />
                      Your brain contains two types of cells:
                    </p>

                    <li>Neurons send and receive electric nerve signals.</li>
                    <li>
                      Glial cells help maintain your brain, form myelin (a
                      fatty, protective substance found in white matter) and
                      provide nutrition to your brain.

                    <p>
                      Within your thalamus sits a small structure called your
                      hypothalamus. Your hypothalamus is part of your limbic
                      system, which controls your emotions. It sends nerve
                      signals to your pituitary gland. It helps control
                      functions such as:
                    </p>

                    <li>Appetite.</li>
                    <li>Body temperature.</li>
                    <li>Emotions.</li>
                    <li>Hormone production.</li>
                    <li>Sleep and wake cycles.</li>

                    <p>
                      In your brain, you also have a pineal gland, which
                      secretes the hormone melatonin. Melatonin controls how
                      melanin gives your skin pigment. Melatonin also plays a
                      role in regulating your sleep and wake cycles.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): A developmental disorder
                      that can affect your ability to communicate, regulate
                      behavior or interpret social cues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Brain tumor: Irregular mass of cells that starts in your

                    <p>
                      Some babies are born with a brain condition. Inherited
                      conditions, genetic differences or injuries in the uterus
                      or at birth can cause these conditions.

                    <p>
                      Injuries can lead to brain damage. When you experience a
                      blow to your head, you may suffer a traumatic brain injury
                      (TBI) or concussion.

                      <br />
                      Rarely, severe brain injuries may lead to a condition like
                      epilepsy or dementia. Many people heal from a concussion
                      or brain injury. Repeated head injuries can lead to
                      chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition that
                      causes progressively worsening thinking problems.
